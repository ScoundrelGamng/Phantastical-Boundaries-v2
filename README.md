# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
